# PyTorch core library for React Native

The PyTorch core library for React Native is part of the PlayTorch project. Please follow the instructions provided on the [PlayTorch website](https://playtorch.dev/) as outlined below!

## üéâ Getting started with PlayTorch
Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://playtorch.dev/docs/tutorials/get-started/). Use the PlayTorch app to get started with no development environment required, or set up a local development environment to build a standalone app by following the [Manual Environment Setup guide](https://playtorch.dev/docs/tutorials/get-started-manually/). We also have a few tutorials for you to keep going after getting started:

* [Image Classification](https://playtorch.dev/docs/tutorials/snacks/image-classification/)
* [Question Answering](https://playtorch.dev/docs/tutorials/snacks/nlp-qa/)
* [Prepare Custom Model](https://playtorch.dev/docs/tutorials/prepare-custom-model/)

## üìñ Documentation

The full documentation for PlayTorch can be found on our [website](https://playtorch.dev/).

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Import dependencies
import * as React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import {
  Camera,
  Image,
  media,
  MobileModel,
  Module,
  Tensor,
  torch,
  torchvision,
} from '@flyskywhy/react-native-pytorch-core';
import { useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

// Alias for torchvision transforms
const T = torchvision.transforms;

// URL to the image classification model that is used in this example
const MODEL_URL =
  'https://github.com/facebookresearch/playtorch/releases/download/v0.1.0/mobilenet_v3_small.ptl';

// URL to the ImageNetClasses JSON file, which is used below to map the
// processed model result to a class label
const IMAGENET_CLASSES_URL =
  'https://github.com/facebookresearch/playtorch/releases/download/v0.1.0/ImageNetClasses.json';

// Variable to hold a reference to the loaded ML model
let model: Module | null = null;

// Variable to hold a reference to the ImageNet classes
let imageNetClasses: string[] | null = null;

// App function to render a camera and a text
export default function App() {
  // Safe area insets to compensate for notches and bottom bars
  const insets = useSafeAreaInsets();
  // Create a React state to store the top class returned from the
  // classifyImage function
  const [topClass, setTopClass] = React.useState(
    "Press capture button to classify what's in the camera view!",
  );

  // Function to handle images whenever the user presses the capture button
  async function handleImage(image: Image) {
    // Get image width and height
    const width = image.getWidth();
    const height = image.getHeight();

    // Convert image to blob, which is a byte representation of the image
    // in the format height (H), width (W), and channels (C), or HWC for short
    const blob = media.toBlob(image);

    // Get a tensor from image the blob and also define in what format
    // the image blob is.
    let tensor = torch.fromBlob(blob, [height, width, 3]);

    // Rearrange the tensor shape to be [CHW]
    tensor = tensor.permute([2, 0, 1]);

    // Divide the tensor values by 255 to get values between [0, 1]
    tensor = tensor.div(255);

    // Crop the image in the center to be a squared image
    const centerCrop = T.centerCrop(Math.min(width, height));
    tensor = centerCrop(tensor);

    // Resize the image tensor to 3 x 224 x 224
    const resize = T.resize(224);
    tensor = resize(tensor);

    // Normalize the tensor image with mean and standard deviation
    const normalize = T.normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]);
    tensor = normalize(tensor);

    // Unsqueeze adds 1 leading dimension to the tensor
    tensor = tensor.unsqueeze(0);

    // If the model has not been loaded already, it will be downloaded from
    // the URL and then loaded into memory.
    if (model === null) {
      const filePath = await MobileModel.download(MODEL_URL);
      model = await torch.jit._loadForMobile(filePath);
    }

    // Run the ML inference with the pre-processed image tensor
    const output = await model.forward<Tensor, Tensor>(tensor);

    // Get the index of the value with the highest probability
    const maxIdx = output.argmax().item();

    if (imageNetClasses === null) {
      const response = await fetch(IMAGENET_CLASSES_URL);
      imageNetClasses = (await response.json()) as string[];
    }

    // Resolve the most likely class label and return it
    const result = imageNetClasses[maxIdx];

    // Set result as top class label state
    setTopClass(result);

    // Release the image from memory
    image.release();
  }

  return (
    <View style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}>
      {/* Render camara and make it parent filling */}
      <Camera
        style={[StyleSheet.absoluteFill, { bottom: insets.bottom }]}
        // Add handle image callback on the camera component
        onCapture={handleImage}
      />
      {/* Label container with custom render style and a text */}
      <View style={styles.labelContainer}>
        {/* Change the text to render the top class label */}
        <Text>{topClass}</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}

// Custom render style for label container
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  labelContainer: {
    padding: 20,
    margin: 20,
    marginTop: 40,
    borderRadius: 10,
    backgroundColor: 'white',
  },
});
```
