PlayTorch is powered by [PyTorch Mobile](https://pytorch.org/mobile) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). Both are active and flourishing open source projects. Expo is an amazing tooling for React Native that makes it incredibly easy to get started with React Native app development.

More details about Expo is here: https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/expo/

In this tutorial, you will use Expo CLI to create an Expo/React Native app with the PlayTorch SDK (i.e., `react-native-pytorch-core`).

## Installation

As a first step, let's follow Expo's installation instructions to set up the development environment for Android and iOS.

### Set up the Expo dependencies

The Expo docs have very detailed step by step guide to install development requirements. Follow their installation instructions on: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/

## Create a New Project

Now that we have set up the Expo environment, let's create a new PlayTorch project and run it in an emulator or on your device.

### Initialize Your Project

Use the `npx create-expo-app` command to initialize your first PlayTorch project.

```shell
npx create-expo-app my-app
```

This is what you should see after the Expo app is created:

```shell title="Expected output"
‚ùØ npx create-expo-app my-app
‚úî Downloaded and extracted project files.
‚úî Installed JavaScript dependencies.

‚úÖ Your project is ready!

To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands.

- cd my-app
- npm run android
- npm run ios
- npm run web
```

### Add PlayTorch SDK

Great! Next, we will add the PlayTorch SDK (i.e., `react-native-pytorch-core`) to the app project. Let's navigate to the newly created app project folder:

```shell
cd my-app
```

Then, run the `npx expo install` command to install the `react-native-pytorch-core` package.

```
npx expo install react-native-pytorch-core
```

```shell title="Expected output"
‚ùØ npx expo install react-native-pytorch-core
‚Ä∫ Installing 1 other package using npm
> npm install --save react-native-pytorch-core

added 1 package, and audited 1123 packages in 2s

52 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities

‚Ä∫ Added config plugin: react-native-pytorch-core
```

### Create Expo Prebuild

Because PlayTorch SDK has native dependencies (C++, Java, Swift), we need to build a custom native app rather than using the Expo Go app. The following command will generate the native source code for Android and iOS (i.e., it will create `android` and `ios` folders within the app project automatically including all configurations described in the [Add Package to Existing App](/docs/tutorials/add-package.mdx) tutorial.)

```shell
npx expo prebuild
```

```shell title="Expected output"
‚ùØ npx expo prebuild

‚úî Created native projects | gitignore skipped

‚Ä∫ Removed "main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js" from package.json because we recommend using index.js as main instead

‚Ä∫ Installing using npm
Warning: This command requires version ^2.1.0 of `sharp-cli`.
Currently installed version: "1.15.0"
Required version: "^2.1.0"
You can install it using `npm install -g sharp-cli@^2.1.0`.

For prerequisites, see: https://sharp.dimens.io/en/stable/install/#prerequisites
¬ª android: userInterfaceStyle: Install expo-system-ui in your project to enable this feature.
‚úî Config synced
‚úî Installed pods and initialized Xcode workspace.
```

### Run Your Project

We are almost there. Now let's run the app project on Android and iOS:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="android" label="Android">

```shell
npm run android
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

```shell
npm run ios
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

If the command fails with a "Watchman error", create an empty `.watchmanconfig` file in the app project root as follows:

```shell
echo "{}" > .watchmanconfig
```

:::

By default, the PlayTorch app will run in an emulator. You can also run it on your own phone which may improve performance. To run it on your phone, connect your phone to your computer and enable Android's developer mode.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="android" label="Android">

:::note

On Android 4.1 and lower, the Developer options screen is available by default. On Android 4.2 and higher, you must enable this screen. To enable developer options, go to **Settings > Developer options** and tap the **Build Number** option 7 times.

More details are on the Android [configure on-device developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).

### Use PlayTorch SDK

Last, let's use the PlayTorch SDK. The example below edits the `App.js` file in the app project root by adding a React state, initialing it with a random tensor, and then rendering the tensor shape and tensor data in the app UI.

```jsx {1,4,7,10} title="App.js"
import { useState } from 'react';
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { torch } from 'react-native-pytorch-core';

export default function App() {
  const [tensor, _setTensor] = useState(torch.rand([2, 3]));
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>{`Random tensor of shape ${tensor.shape} with data ${tensor.data()}`}</Text>
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```
